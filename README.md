My program is a moving picture  

Basically when you move the mouse the Red and green colors change for the ones moving horizontally across the screen. 
However the vertical circles blue and green circles are linked to the mousex and mousey cordinates
If you hit 'a' the colors should decrease the red values for the sideBall, and decrease the blue values for the upBall.
If you were to hit 'd' the colors would increase the red values for the sideball and decrease the values for the upBall.
